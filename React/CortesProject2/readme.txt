For the undergraduate and graduate degrees, I have an accordion UI element. 
This shows a more detailed description (dropdown) of the degrees upon clicking.

For the Employers and Careers section, I used a List UI element to display these.

For the Employment Table and the Co-op Table, I used a Table UI element with Pagination.
This allows the user to quickly skim through the list, controlling how many results
show up per page and the user is able to navigate to multiple pages.

For People (Faculty and Staff), I used the Tabs UI element.
